```cpp
scanf("%lld", &x); // read long long int
printf("%lld", x); // print long long int
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

 ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

// Note: With synchronization turned off, only use cin to read input.
// Another option is to not use iostreams at all. scanf is fast enough and should almost never cause issues.
